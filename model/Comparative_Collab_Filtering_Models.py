	A module of different Comparative Collaborative Filtering:
		1. Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering
		2. Biased Matrix Factorisation 
		3. Local Low-Rank Matrix Factorisation

	AIDEN: This is something I recommend you working on the problem of importing (or writing) the other methods of 
	collaborative filtering. The ones I've listed above are the ones AutoRec was tested against. But there may be 
	better ones - especially GNN models that may provide a better picture.
